# world_time
 
This is a flutter world time app hugely inspired from The Net Ninja. 

 I have changed some of the code and now this app works for timezones which are negative for example New York (GMT-4) 
 I have written additional code to make it work for coutries which have minutes also to be added for example New Delhi (GMT+5:30)  
 
 Plus I have had to do some changes in the code here and there because the flutter syntax has changed a lot since Net Ninja made the code. 
 
 This app works fine with no issues as of 22 Jul 2022.  
 So if you are following Net Nija's tutorials I hope this git respiratory will be helpul for you. 
 And thanks a ton to Net Ninja for making such a great series on flutter for beginners.  
 important - if you are cloning the repo to your desktop, you will need to perform a packages get / pub get to install any dependencies that the project may have at that point of the course.
